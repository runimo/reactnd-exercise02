### Exercise 2 - Passing Data

This was the 2nd exercise in the Udacity React Nanodegree.

The task in this exercise was to display a list of movies and the users that liked them. The goal was to make the App modular by breaking it down into reusable components.

I added some styling to make it look nicer.
